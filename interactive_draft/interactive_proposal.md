# Project Proposal on Urbanization Analysis in Africa

## Researcher
** Akshar Katariya **

## Project Description
This project will analyze urbanization trends across African nations to identify factors driving urban growth, explore spatial distributions of urban areas, and understand socio-economic implications. The study will utilize data from the Africapolis platform, which compiles information on the urban agglomerations of various African countries.

**Africapolis**
   - **URL**: [Africapolis Data Browser](https://africapolis.org/en/data?country=Angola&keyfigure=numAgglos&menu=browser&type=abs&year=2020)
   - **Description**: The Africapolis dataset provides data on urban agglomerations across Africa, including metrics like the number of agglomerations, population sizes, and spatial distribution. The data helps in identifying patterns of urbanization across regions, with options to filter by country, type of data, and year. The data includes attributes related to urban area development, density, and changes over time.


## Plan
I plan to make this a dynamic ensamble (Option B) where I present a few interactives, but with limited bells and whistles

### Example 1:
#### URL: [Population Map NYC](http://manpopex.us)
#### How I plan to use this:
I like this way of visualizing population densities. Doing it over the entire continent of Africa will give viewers a chance to get a birds-eye-view understanding of 
population densitiies in the cities of Africa

### Example 2:
#### URL: [2020 Election Results](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html)
#### How I plan to use this:
I like this way of visualizing a whole, but also giving a chance to dive deeper into the state. I plan to do the same with African nations. If a viewer wants to know more, they can hover over the country.

## Questions
- How feasible is it to make tooltips with graphs like it is showed in the picture?
- I think this data might be a little thin and uninteresting with only population statistics, and I was thinking of attaching more data such as GDP or other economic data. Do you have any suggestions/examples that I can refer to for visualizing another domain like economics along with urbanization?

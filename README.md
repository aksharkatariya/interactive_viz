# Energy Compostion in the US 
Author: Akshar Katariya

Description: This project visualizes the energy mix, clean energy goals, and state-level comparisons for various U.S. states. It allows users to select a state and view a detailed breakdown of its energy sources, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar, and more, represented through stacked bar chart. 
Additionally, the project features a map of the U.S., where states are color-coded based on their clean energy goals. This interactive visualization aims to provide insights into the progress and diversity of energy usage across the country.
